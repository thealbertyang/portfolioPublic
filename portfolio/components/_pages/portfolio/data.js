With knowledge of MVC, I decided to build the application with the framework Laravel. The business functions of this app required two backends. One for the HR managers to manage participants and one for trainees. The administrative backend utilizes Voyager and features the ability to open new sessions of training classes, and deactivate the class when it is over. Participants could be managed on the administrative back-end and added to the training sessions. On the users backend, the users were able to maneuver the class they were in and collect badges. The accolades reveals the points and badges collected. The app demonstrated my ability in Laravel, PHP and UI/UX.'

I created the backend portal from scratch to understand MVC as a whole. The portal had simple routing, encrypted authentication, dynamic models and controllers and the ability to load vendor libraries. It also features a timesheet pdf and an excel generator (which is styled unlike csv). I utilized the Consolibyte Quickbooks to connect via OAuth to utilize the API. There were two backends. One of which was for employees to log, edit and submit their hours to their employees. The other backend was for JLMâ€™s admin to manage companies, projects, supervisors, process invoices, view timesheets, and among other functions.'

The platform they used was WordPress. I redesigned their website on Enfold for quick wire-framing, heavily utilizing CSS for theme customization. Images chosen summarized the company\'s culture. On Photoshop, most images were adjusted with an offset to exposure, rendering a faded style. With the shots incorporating modern day objects, the fade creates a feeling of contemporary yet mature look to it. To further keep up with the trends, I extended the functionalities of the theme with a hamburger overlay menu built entirely in JQuery and CSS. Enfold was lacking this feature so I implemented this on my own. Using PHP to push the envelopes of the Enfold theme, I created a nifty next project module utilizing the WordPress functions and hooks, and made customization to the Instagram plugin.'
